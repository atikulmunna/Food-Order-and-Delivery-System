- **Description**

This project demonstrates the core functionality of any food delivery service out there in the real world. Letting the user navigate through the interface by menu-driven actions has been the ideal layout of any product delivery application, let it be web or system optimized. Taking that into note, we tried to embody an easy-to-understand, user-friendly food delivery program that covers the basic libraries, syntaxes, functions we have learnt throughout this course in both theory and lab classes. The program initiates by showing the user a welcome menu and a few options to choose from including signing up, signing in or terminate the program entirely. Then based on the choice, it lets the user choose directly from restaurant brochures or a pretty long list of delicious food items. The user, then inputs the ID of whatever food(s) he/she like(s) in preferred numbers and the program adds the item(s) to the temporary cart. After every successful run of the loop, the program gives the user freedom to stop choosing and go back to the cart then and there. Using a simple calculation technique, it then sums up the total bill. Finally, it prompts the user to confirm the order and shows an ending message if confirmed. The user have the option to cancel the order at any point too. Our aim was to write a simplified and beautifully effective code without overdoing things and so we have avoided the implementation of pre-defined/ built-in complex libraries.<br/><br/>

- **Our Story Behind the Project**

E-commerce has become a revolutionary sector since the start of 21st century. Conventional shopping seems like an outdated idea in this age of Amazon, Alibaba and eBay. Nowadays, people rely on online shopping for basically everything they need. From a simple notebook to expensive home appliances, there is nothing that can’t be found online. E-food is also becoming a popular idea among the youth. Since Pizza Hut pioneered the way back in 1994, online food ordering business is booming exponentially. Who wouldn’t love to sit comfortably on sofa watching a blockbuster movie on television and getting a favorite food item delivered from a restaurant hundreds of miles away without even stepping a foot outside! Our group project is based on this scenario where it’s nothing but a reality. Ordering food online has become a life-saving phenomenon since the deadly Covid-19 virus has emerged. Contactless food ordering and delivery is one of the precautions we must maintain to keep our loved ones safe which also keeps the food businesses and millions of people relying on it for their livelihood alive. Our project may not exceed the likes of UberEats, Zomato or FoodPanda in terms of user interface, performance or stability but it’s inspired by the same impulse that made those world-famous startups possible. Though it is an offline program, we want this project to be the seed of something noteworthy that would provide us the motivation to keep crafting effective and elegant codes in rest of our courses as well as professional life.<br/><br/>
